## Demo Sonos Controller App with Netlify Functions

The Controller Demo is built using Gatsby, and uses `netlify-lambda` locally for any function calls.

### Running Locally
*Setup local environment variables:*
From the terminal run the following commands with your ClientId and Secret
* export SONOS_CLIENT_ID="YOUR CLIENT ID"
* export SONOS_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR CLIENT SECRET"

To run locally use `npm run start`. This will start a local netlify instance and build the Gatsby project.
